# cfwheels-api

This repository is for the CFWheels API documentation site. It is a good example of how to structure your CFWheels application and keep the core framework files out of your repository. This project uses three dependencies, one is the core CFWheels framework, the next is a CFWheels plugin, and lastly a module from ForgeBox not written specifically for CFWheels.
